# Data Analysis Project: 2024 US Presidential Election Dataset

## Files Used
- **Datasets**:  
  - `2024_fb_ads_president_scored_anon.csv`  
  - `2024_fb_posts_president_scored_anon.csv`  
  - `2024_tw_posts_president_scored_anon.csv`

- **Python Scripts**:  
  - `pure_python_stats.py`  
  - `pandas_stats.py`  
  - `polars_stats.py`

## Objective of Analysis
The objective of this analysis is to:
- Perform descriptive statistics on datasets from Facebook and Twitter.
- Compare performance across **Pure Python**, **Pandas**, and **Polars**.
- Analyze key metrics such as count, mean, min, max, and standard deviation for numeric columns, and the most frequent values for categorical columns.

## Python Files
1. **`pure_python_stats.py`**: Performs analysis using **Pure Python**.
2. **`pandas_stats.py`**: Uses **Pandas** to calculate and output statistics.
3. **`polars_stats.py`**: Analyzes data using **Polars**, focusing on performance and accuracy.

## Output Suggested
- **Overall Statistics**: Count, mean, min, max, and standard deviation for numeric columns.
- **Categorical Columns**: Most frequent value and its count, along with unique values.
- Outputs are saved as text files for comparison.

## Comparison of Outputs
- The project compares the results of **Pure Python**, **Pandas**, and **Polars** using the same datasets, focusing on the accuracy of statistics and performance (execution time).
- Outputs for each method will be available in text files for side-by-side comparison.

## Conclusion
This analysis helps in understanding the effectiveness and performance of **Pandas** vs **Polars** in handling large datasets, with **Pure Python** serving as a baseline.
